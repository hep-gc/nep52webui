This directory contains the code for the NEP-52 web portal.

The idea is to have most of the web portal 'shell' implemented by
Drupal, and have the dynamic content related to the NEP-52 project
served by a simple web application, currently written using cherrypy.

IMPORTANT:
This is currently still in a 'prototype' state, and will likely be
refactored on an ongoing basis.
